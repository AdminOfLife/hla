# HLA - a portable, multiplatform assembly language

# About

High Level Assembly (HLA) is a tool created by Randally Hyde for introducing students to assembly programming. The official HLA website has been unmaintained for some time, so we hope to renew it here on GitHub. HLA is intended as a multiplatform language; the same HLA code will run on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD.
